# Student Assistant App
The Student Assistant App is an Android mobile application that helps students with time management and organization. The application allows the user to add the information of courses (Course Name, Professor Name, Units, Start Time, End Time, Days) and store those courses in a list. From this list, the user can select a course to see the information about that course. Additionally, the user can edit the course information or delete the course if they choose to.  

We plan on adding more features in the future that will make the application a better assistant for students. Some features that we will develop in the future are:
* Custom alarms and notifications
* GPA Calculator
* Weighted Grade Calculator
* Study Time Manager
